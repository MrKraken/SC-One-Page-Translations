# MrKraken's One Page Guide Translations
## 2025-06-20 Update
Due to the overwhelming support for the community by translators, it's become clear that single-origin translation rendering simply causes me far too much stress and eats up a *lot* of time that I don't have to spare.

I still want to support the translation of my guides as much as possible though! So what I will be doing going forward is:
- Pushing the `/GuideName/` folder to this repository when I feel it's 'final'

The folders will contain
- Textless guide with a community translation disclaimer baked in
- My English text layer rendered out as transparent PNG so you can overlay it whilst translating
- Any icons that I make and use within the text will be supplied
- Any ***free*** fonts will be alongside/linked to
  - CIG use a lot of premium fonts that I have licensed or have been willing to license when creating guides/videos.
  - This is part of why I originally setup translations so that I would render them, to avoid premium font issues
- I'll do my best to extract all text & supply alongside, it might not be pretty but hopefully it will help
- Translators are welcome to use the `#translation-station` channel in [my Discord](https://discord.gg/mrkraken) to discuss & collaborate
  - Trusted members will be granted role permissions to reply to my one-page threads in the `#sc-resources` channel

# License
You have my permission and blessing to use the supplied files for the purposes of translating my one-page guides for the Star Citizen community.

However, ensure not to remove/obscure the 'Made by the Community image', RSI footer disclaimer, my socials information or the community translation disclaimer.
