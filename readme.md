## MrKraken's One Page Guide Translations
This repository is dedicated to my one-page guides. I make them in illustrator and from 2025-03-20 am setting them up in a way for people to contribute translations.
You can find the rendered versions on my [Community Hub profile](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/community-hub/user/MrKraken)
The final versions will all be posted alongside my main image with credit to the translators

## Where is the folder for ______?
Early in the PTU cycle I mark the first version of a guide and then iterate throughout the cycle. When I think there won't be many changes (normally when the patches become release candidates), I'll add the guide folder and begin accepting translations.
*Older guides like my original XenoThreat & Supply or Die are not setup for translations*

## Where did Hathor go?
Unfortunately Illustrator started crashing whenever I tried to load the translations. So, hopefully only 'for now' Hathor has been removed.

I'm now using new software to handle translations starting with Stormbreaker, and will be adding that to the repository soon & updating translation instructions

## How to use
- In \GUIDENAME\ folders there will be a master.json file:
  ```
  {
        "Language": "en_GB",
        "Build": "4.2-PTU-9868328-RC2",
        "Translated_By": "MrKraken"
  },
  {
        "Language": "example",
        "Build": "4.2-PTU-9868328-RC2",
        "Translated_By": ""
  }
  ```
  Add your translation after `}` being sure to add a comma `,` after the example object:
    ```
    {
        "Language": "en_GB",
        "Build": "4.2-PTU-9868328-RC2",
        "Translated_By": "MrKraken"
  },
  {
        "Language": "example",
        "Build": "4.2-PTU-9868328-RC2",
        "Translated_By": ""
  },
  {
        "Language": "fr_FR",
        "Build": "4.2-PTU-9868328-RC2",
        "Translated_By": "MonsieurKraken"
  }
  ```
